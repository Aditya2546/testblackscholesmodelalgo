   - Feed results back to ML model for continuous improvement

## Machine Learning Integration

The system incorporates machine learning at multiple levels:

1. **Signal Generation**:
   - Hybrid LSTM-GARCH model for volatility forecasting
   - Features include technical indicators, option chain metrics, and market sentiment
   - Fast retraining capability for adapting to market regime changes

2. **Risk Management**:
   - Probabilistic modeling of market scenarios
   - Reinforcement learning for dynamic position sizing
   - Anomaly detection for unusual market conditions

3. **Execution Optimization**:
   - Learning optimal execution timing based on intraday patterns
   - Predicting fill probabilities at different price levels
   - Adapting to changing market microstructure

## Deployment Architecture

The system is designed for robustness and performance:

- **Docker Containerization**: All components packaged as containers
- **Configuration**: YAML and environment-based configuration
